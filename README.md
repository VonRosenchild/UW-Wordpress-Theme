# University of Washington Wordpress Theme

## About

This theme is the latest updated UW Wordpress theme as of September 2012.
For the time being the master branch is under heavy development and could potentially be broken.
It is recommended to clone the repository and then checkout the latest tag as each tag is a stable release.

The theme is meant to act not only as a standalone theme but as a skeleton for child themes. 
If there are desired features or changes, our team's philosophy is to create a child theme 
  and edit as little as possible of this theme's code by overriding and adding files via the child theme.

**Important: The Web Team does not provide support for sites running our theme but not hosted by us. This includes
special features, documentation, and training that is provided to sites we host. If you find a bug, please send your 
bug fix to us. If the bug is on our end, we will update it with the next release.

**Please note: the theme that was originally here has been moved to the 2011 branch.
  It can also be found with all its tags in its separate repo: [UW-Wordpress-Child-Theme](https://github.com/uweb/UW-Wordpress-Child-Theme)*
